# Bequeathing of the Turnip

Many of the Root Cellar's Denizens are SOS students. At some gathering before the end of a given SOS class, these students should nominate instructors to be honored by the Cellar. The instructor chosen for recognition should be presented with a turnip at the final class of that SOS group. The presenter will say simply: "The Root Cellar recognizes and thanks you." No further explanation is permitted.
